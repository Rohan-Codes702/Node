 

This repository is created to explore and practice **Node.js** step by step. It contains both the fundamental concepts of Node.js and small projects that apply these concepts in real-world scenarios. The purpose of this repository is to build a strong foundation in backend development while also gaining hands-on experience by working on practical examples.  

Inside the repository, you will find different folders and files that are organized to make learning easier. The **concepts section** includes examples of core Node.js topics such as modules, the file system, events, streams, and HTTP servers. Each concept is demonstrated with simple code snippets to help in understanding how Node.js works under the hood.  

Along with concepts, this repository also includes **mini-projects** that provide practical experience. These projects are designed to show how multiple Node.js features can be combined to build something useful. Examples include creating a basic HTTP server, building a notes app, working with REST APIs, and implementing simple CRUD operations.  

The goal of this repository is to provide a clear path for anyone who wants to learn Node.js from scratch and grow towards building real-world backend applications. It can be used as a personal learning resource, a daily coding practice space, or even as a reference for revising Node.js fundamentals quickly.  

This repository will keep growing with new concepts and projects being added regularly, making it a valuable resource for continuous learning.
